# Pretty Important Preface
Citadel-Crud is a hihgly experimental piece of software. It is rapidly changing scope, direction, and API in order to suit the needs that I have for it.

At the moment, I'm not recommending that anybody file any issues or attempt to contribute to it. Although it's published on crates.io, it's not intended for use.

However...

# Step 1: Cite the use case in any issue
This could be anything from 'we should have a macro to open the connection' to 'hey, we should fix updaters... becuase they're broken'

# Step 2: Create a conformant pull-request
It's not hard to conform to the rust code here. In fact, if it compiles we'll accept it basically.

# Step 3: Profit!
Well, probably not... It's written in Rust, after all. But, success! Your feature is now a part of citadel_crud!
